# CatBoost Model Improvement Rules - Usage Guide

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive rule set and implementation plan for improving your CatBoost rental price prediction model. The rules are designed to address critical issues identified in your current implementation and provide a structured approach to building a production-ready, high-performance prediction system.

## Files Created

1. **`catboost_model_improvement_rules.json`** - Comprehensive rule set with 12 categories covering all aspects of model improvement
2. **`CatBoost_Model_Improvement_Plan.md`** - Detailed implementation guide with phases, timelines, and specific actions
3. **`README_Model_Improvement_Rules.md`** - This usage guide

## Quick Start

### Immediate Actions (This Week)

1. **Fix Critical Pipeline Issues**
   ```bash
   # Debug the DateTransformer compatibility issue
   python -c "from transformers import DateTransformer; print('Testing DateTransformer import')"
   
   # Test prediction pipeline with different inputs
   python prediction.py
   ```

2. **Verify Model Behavior**
   ```bash
   # Check if predictions vary with different inputs
   # Current issue: identical predictions ($621.05) regardless of input changes
   ```

3. **Increase Hyperparameter Tuning**
   ```python
   # In model_training.py, change:
   # study.optimize(objective, n_trials=5)  # Current
   # study.optimize(objective, n_trials=50)  # Improved
   ```

## How to Use the Rules

### 1. Rule Categories

The rules are organized into 12 categories, each addressing specific aspects of your model:

- **Model Architecture**: CatBoost optimization and ensemble methods
- **Feature Engineering**: Advanced feature creation and selection
- **Data Quality**: Validation and monitoring pipelines
- **Performance**: Evaluation metrics and validation strategies
- **Pipeline Reliability**: Error handling and monitoring
- **Real-time Learning**: Online learning and model updates
- **Interpretability**: SHAP, LIME, and explanation tools
- **Production**: Deployment and scaling considerations
- **Infrastructure**: Data pipelines and system architecture
- **Business Intelligence**: Market analysis and business metrics
- **Continuous Improvement**: Research and development framework
- **Monitoring**: Real-time tracking and alerting

### 2. Implementation Priorities

Follow the priority levels defined in the rules:

- **CRITICAL**: Fix pipeline errors (1-2 days)
- **HIGH**: Performance optimization (1-2 weeks)
- **MEDIUM**: Feature engineering and production readiness (3-6 weeks)
- **LOW**: Advanced research and development (2-3 months)

### 3. Success Metrics

Track these key metrics to measure improvement:

- **Prediction Accuracy**: MAPE < 8%, MAE < $50
- **Model Robustness**: Â±2% accuracy across different conditions
- **Pipeline Reliability**: 99.5% uptime, <500ms response time
- **Business Impact**: 5-10% revenue optimization improvement

## Integration with Existing Workflow

### Current Issues Identified

1. **Pipeline Failures**: `DateTransformer` compatibility issues
2. **Identical Predictions**: Model returning same value regardless of inputs
3. **Limited Optimization**: Only 5 Optuna trials for hyperparameter tuning
4. **No Monitoring**: Lack of data quality and model performance monitoring

### Recommended Workflow Changes

1. **Add Pre-commit Hooks**
   ```bash
   # Add pipeline validation tests
   # Ensure all transformers are sklearn-compatible
   # Test prediction variance with different inputs
   ```

2. **Implement Continuous Integration**
   ```bash
   # Add automated testing for all pipeline components
   # Test model training and prediction pipelines
   # Validate data quality and model performance
   ```

3. **Regular Model Reviews**
   ```bash
   # Weekly: Check prediction accuracy and pipeline health
   # Monthly: Review feature importance and model performance
   # Quarterly: Evaluate new techniques and business requirements
   ```

## Code Quality Standards

### Testing Requirements
- Minimum 90% code coverage for all pipeline components
- Unit tests for all transformers and feature engineering steps
- Integration tests for end-to-end prediction pipeline
- Performance tests for training and inference speed

### Documentation Standards
