# CatBoost Rental Price Prediction Model Improvement Plan

## Executive Summary

Based on the comprehensive analysis of your rental price prediction model, I've identified critical issues and created a structured improvement plan. The current model shows concerning behavior where predictions remain constant ($621.05) regardless of significant changes in input features like Capital Value, indicating potential pipeline or feature engineering problems.

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. **Pipeline Failures (CRITICAL)**
- `DateTransformer` compatibility issues causing `get_feature_names_out` errors
- Prediction pipeline returning identical results regardless of input changes
- Feature engineering steps failing silently in some cases

### 2. **Limited Model Optimization (HIGH)**
- Only 5 Optuna trials for hyperparameter tuning (insufficient for optimal performance)
- Single model approach without ensemble methods
- Suboptimal CatBoost configuration

### 3. **Data Quality Concerns (HIGH)**
- No automated data validation or drift detection
- Limited outlier detection and handling
- Missing data quality monitoring

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Days 1-3)
**Priority: CRITICAL**

1. **Fix Pipeline Compatibility Issues**
   ```python
   # Fix DateTransformer to implement get_feature_names_out
   # Update FeatureEngineering class for sklearn compatibility
   # Test prediction pipeline thoroughly
   ```

2. **Validate Model Predictions**
   ```python
   # Debug why predictions are identical for different inputs
   # Check feature transformation pipeline
   # Verify model is actually using all features
   ```

### Phase 2: Model Performance Enhancement (Weeks 1-2)
**Priority: HIGH**

1. **Advanced Hyperparameter Tuning**
   ```python
   # Increase Optuna trials from 5 to 50-100
   # Implement multi-objective optimization
   # Add cross-validation to objective function
   ```

2. **Ensemble Implementation**
   ```python
   # Combine CatBoost with LightGBM and XGBoost
   # Implement stacking or voting ensemble
   # Add model diversity through different feature subsets
   ```

### Phase 3: Feature Engineering Enhancement (Weeks 2-4)
**Priority: HIGH**

1. **Advanced Feature Creation**
   - Polynomial features and feature interactions
   - Time-based features (seasonality, trends)
   - Geographical features (distance to amenities)
   - Market condition indicators

2. **Feature Selection and Validation**
   - Recursive feature elimination
   - Correlation analysis and redundancy removal
   - Feature importance tracking over time

### Phase 4: Production Readiness (Weeks 4-8)
**Priority: MEDIUM**

1. **Data Validation Pipeline**
   - Implement Great Expectations for data quality
   - Add automated drift detection
   - Create data profiling and monitoring

2. **Model Monitoring and Alerting**
   - Real-time performance monitoring
   - Automated retraining triggers
   - Business impact tracking

# Ensure DateTransformer implements required methods
# Test with different input values to verify predictions change
```

### 2. Increase Optuna Trials (Day 2)
```python
# Change n_trials from 5 to 50 in model_training.py
# Add cross-validation to objective function
# Monitor training time and adjust accordingly
```

### 3. Add Basic Monitoring (Day 3)
```python
# Log all predictions with timestamps
# Add feature value logging
# Create simple prediction variance checks
```

## Technical Debt Priority

1. **CRITICAL**: DateTransformer pipeline compatibility (1-2 days)

3. **MEDIUM**: Missing error handling and validation (1-2 weeks)
4. **MEDIUM**: Lack of comprehensive testing (2-3 weeks)
5. **LOW**: Limited interpretability features (1-2 weeks)

## Resource Requirements

### Development Time
- **Phase 1 (Critical)**: 2-3 days full-time
- **Phase 2 (Performance)**: 1-2 weeks part-time
- **Phase 3 (Features)**: 2-3 weeks part-time
- **Phase 4 (Production)**: 3-4 weeks part-time

### Infrastructure
- GPU resources for training (current setup appears adequate)
- Additional storage for model versioning and data archiving
- Monitoring and alerting infrastructure

### Skills/Knowledge
