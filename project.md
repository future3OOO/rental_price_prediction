# Rental Price Prediction Model Project

## Overview
This codebase is designed for predicting rental prices using machine learning techniques. It includes modules for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## Code Structure
- **Data Preprocessing**: Modules for loading, cleaning, and preprocessing data, including handling missing values and scaling features.
- **Feature Engineering**: Code to extract and create useful features that improve prediction accuracy.
- **Model Training**: Scripts that implement and train models (e.g., using scikit-learn) for estimating rental prices.
- **Evaluation**: Scripts to assess model performance using metrics such as MAE, RMSE, etc., with results possibly logged in output files like `output.txt`.
- **Outputs**: Output files, including `output.txt`, which contain prediction results and performance measures.
- **Documentation**: This file serves as an overview of the project structure and important components.

## Key Components
- **Data Input**: Reading and validation of input data from various sources (e.g., CSV files, databases).
- **Data Processing**: Data cleaning, normalization, and transformation to prepare features for modeling.
- **Model Implementation**: Use of regression algorithms, decision trees, or ensemble methods to train rental price prediction models.
- **Model Evaluation**: Tools to visualize and assess model accuracy, including error metrics and graphical analysis.
- **User Guidance**: Instructions for setting up the environment, installing dependencies, and running the main scripts.

## Usage
1. Install all required dependencies (e.g., Python 3.x, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy).
2. Run the main scripts to preprocess data and train the prediction model.
3. Check `output.txt` for logged predictions and evaluation metrics.
4. Modify configurations or parameters within the code as needed for experimentation.
